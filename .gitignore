# Compiled Go packages (Go Modules)
# The binary cache and module download cache are usually outside the project,
# but if you build with -pkgdir, you might get a pkg/ directory.
# The 'vendor' directory is typically committed if Go Modules are not used
# or if you specifically choose to manage dependencies this way, but with modern
# Go Modules, it's often ignored if it's only a local cache.
# The standard recommendation is to *not* ignore 'vendor' if it exists.
# However, if you are sure you don't need it in Git:
# vendor/

# Standard build outputs
# Compiled binaries, often placed in the current directory or a 'bin' directory.
# Replace 'myprogram' with your actual binary name if needed.
# For example, if your main package is in the root:
# myprogram
# If you place all binaries in a 'bin' directory:
bin/
# Or if you use a 'build' directory:
build/
